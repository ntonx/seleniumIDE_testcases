# SeleniumIDE tool

This is a Selenium funcionality that helps to perform web testing in a web interface (plugin), in which we can select  actions (click on buttoms, write content, move on webpages, open links, save variables, etc.) on webpages to interact with it. After select and define some actions, we can test these actions that are saved in a selenese script. SeleniumIDE gives the option to transform scripts in other languagues (Java, Python, JS, etc) files.

SeleniumIDE help to prototype test cases in order to define in an easily way interactions with webpage elements. The result of these interactions can be recorded and we can save these interactions in a file (.side extension).
